# Welcome to Syntactic Processing Code Demonstrations:

This README file is designed to navigate the **code files** and the **datasets** that have been used to demonstrate the use cases of various concepts taught in the Syntactic Processing module. 

### What is where?

Each file is placed in their well named respective folders and each folder contains two folders:

1. **Code files**: This is where you can find the notebooks that have been demonstrated in the module.
2. **Dataset:** This is where all the datasets you will need to run the notebooks are kept.

There are a total of 6 folders as mentioned below:

1. **Heteronyms Detection POS Tagging Use Case:** This folder contains the code files of heteronyms detection use case that have been demonstrated in PoS tagging session.
2. **POS Tagging Case Study:** This folder contains the code files and dataset of features extraction using PoS tagging case study that have been demonstrated in PoS tagging session.
3. **Dependency Parsing:** This folder contains the code files and dataset of active passive sentence detection use case that have been demonstrated in Parsing session.
4. **NER Code Demonstration:** This folder contains the code files of NER use case that have been demonstrated in NER and CRF session.
5. **Custom NER Code Demonstration:** This folder contains the code files and dataset of CRF use case that have been demonstrated in NER and CRF session.
